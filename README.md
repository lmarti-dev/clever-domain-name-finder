# Clever domain name finder
A little tool with a GUI in `tkinter` to look up what words end in specific tlds. 

Depends on `tkentrycomplete.py` created by Mitja Martini, updated by Russell Adams.

Here are some examples with `.be`

```
marru.be
mesola.be
micro.be
micropro.be
misascri.be
misdescri.be
mistranscri.be
motorpho.be
multilo.be
multitu.be
```
